What is Discord? \u00b6 Discord is a popular communication platform. Users can interact with each other via text, voice, or video - either privately or as part of a \"server\". Discord servers are managed communities of users, generally dedicated to a particular topic or interest. You can find a Discord server for just about anything! Benefits \u00b6 Discord is free, well-supported, and can run on just about any desktop or mobile platform. This makes it an ideal communication platform for the CodingNomads community. The CodingNomads Discord server provides a central hub for instant communication with other members of the community. The server is structured into various channels with purposefully-designated topics. This ensures that requests for help target an audience that is most qualified to contribute meaningful assistance. Channels are also divided into groups. General channels are accessible by all members of the community and as such are community-supported. Mentored students have access to additional private channels which are actively supported by the CodingNomads mentorship team. The server also provides dedicated 1-on-1 DM channels for communication between students and mentors, along with voice calls and screen-sharing capabilities for recurring and impromptu support sessions. Getting Started \u00b6 We recommend getting started by downloading and installing the desktop client for the best experience. On initial launch, you can create an account. You can use a single account to join multiple servers, while setting a different server nickname for each. This allows you to use your real name on the CodingNomads server, and a pseudonym on others. Discord also supports multiple user accounts and offers simple account switching within the app if that works better for you. Once your account is set up, click this link to join the CodingNomads server. After clicking Join , you'll end up in the #entry channel, which displays the server's code of conduct. You won't be able to take any action until you click the Complete button, which will display the screen below. This requires a validated email address, and agreement to read and abide by the code of conduct. After clicking Submit , you'll find yourself in the #entry channel, which displays the servers code of conduct. Please read it carefully, before clicking the button to agree. When you click the button, you'll be asked to enter your real name - this will automatically set your nickname for the server. Afterwards, you'll receive the private message below. You have now joined the CodingNomads Discord server, it's great to have you here! You'll notice the #entry channel is now gone from your channel list and a few new channels are available including: about-us : This channel offers additional information about CodingNomads and the Discord server. -- Start here -- ask-questions : A place for the general public to ask non-technical questions about CodingNomads. If you are currently a paying member or mentored student, within minutes additional channels will automatically unlock. If they do not, send a quick message in #ask-questions and support staff will get it sorted out right away. Using Discord \u00b6 Now that you've joined the server, you can start chatting right away. Members have access to the #general channel, a great place for discussion on just about anything (mostly non-technical). For technical questions, there are a series of #general-... channels for members looking for language or topic-specific support. These channels are community supported, so feel free to jump in and offer a helping hand if you can ! The favor will come back your way the next time you get stuck on a tricky problem and need a little advice. Head over to the #introduce-yourself channel and share a short message with your motivations & goals. You can include reasons why you've decided to learn programming and become a part of the CodingNomads community. We are happy to have you here! Check out #interest-management where you can add topics of interest to your profile. This allows members with similar interests more easily find each other, communicate, and ask for or offer support. Looking for a laugh? #coding-memes has been a long time staple in the community for (family-friendly) fun. Feel free to post things that community members can relate to, just be sure to keep it clean! \ud83d\ude1c As mentioned earlier, mentored students have access to additional channels for support and dedicated 1-on-1 mentor communication. Look for a #your-name channel. Your mentor can walk you through using the Discord voice channel and screen sharing features for your sessions. Posting Code \u00b6 Writing a message that contains code with Discord is easy using backticks. For small one-liners, or method and variable names you can use single backticks (`): What exactly does the `shrink()` method do? Renders as: What exactly does the shrink() method do? `Hey, I'm a piece of code!` Renders as: Hey, I'm a piece of code! For larger blocks of code like complete methods, classes, etc., surround the code with triple backticks (```) for a better result: public int shrink(int number) { return number - 1; } Down the Road \u00b6 Discord messages in most channels do not expire. This offers the opportunity to search and reference previously posted questions, solutions, and other helpful information at a later time. Next time you're about to post a request for help, give it a try! One exception is a mentored student's dedicated mentor support channel. When your mentorship program comes to an end, this channel will be deleted and all history will be lost. If you would like to archive these messages before the channel is deleted, please let a staff member know. Mentored students will retain lifetime access to the Discord server, while members will not. CodingNomads Discord server access is limited to currently subscribed members at any given time. If your membership subscription is canceled, you will lose access to the server. Thanks \u00b6 Hope this guide has helped you get a bit more acquainted with Discord, looking forward to seeing everyone there!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#codingnomads-discord-guide","text":"This guide will introduce you to Discord and walk you through installing and using it to connect to the CodingNomads server.","title":"CodingNomads Discord Guide"},{"location":"#what-is-discord","text":"Discord is a popular communication platform.
